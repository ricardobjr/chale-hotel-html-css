### The project was developed with the aim of applying basic html and css3 concepts, with the objective of simulating the web page of a fictional hotel. In it we can find one file in HTML format and a folder containing sixteen images. The project allows the user to see how liquid adjustment can be applied using HTML5 in conjunction with CSS3.
